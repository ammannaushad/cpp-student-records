In this project, I used enum, typedef, string operations, and custom namespaces to create a Student's Record. In this project, student's name, grade levels, and GPA are defined. I also tried to improve the structure and readability of my code. 
Moreover, one can type "g++ main.cpp -o records" to compile the program, then can run it by typing, "./records."
